<h1>2024 Diary Entries</h1>
<p><h4>Day 06/07/24:</h4></p>
    <p><em>Today was a great day I reinforced my html learning!
        On the other hand I had a decent breakfast, a killer workout, 
        and a <strong>quite</strong> fulfilling lunch. I am currently working on my html practice, 
        however it is going good because I am nearly done with the practice and can play some videogames soon.
        But no that I think about it I might not be able to play games because I forgot that I need to grind the 
        day trading app since I currently have money in it and I'm down a few cents. I just got a little anxiety, 
        because I started to think about the instashopper self-employed job that I have. 
        I got anxieic because I know it gets me good cash but I just don't want to leave the studies and projects that I have 
        at home to start that project. I would have to be fully engaged in just instashopper. I'm going to use the excuse that 
        it is super humid out, and that it takes my mileage away and I only have a certain amount I can use every year. So I'm probably going to 
        use that excuse not to go out and make money. Although i do want to contribute to society any way I can. I don't think society will hold it against me 
        since I'm still only a novice teenager still. That's why I want to dedicate my life to helping others through creating inventions that will help the people.
        I don't have ideas yet, or any I would give out publicly but it excites me that I was given this opprotunity to rise, and make a name for myself, while helping others along the way.
       <strong>Hopefully</strong>  by me writing this I can manifest it into existence, but I do know that I have to be weary that there will still be highs and lows no matter what.
